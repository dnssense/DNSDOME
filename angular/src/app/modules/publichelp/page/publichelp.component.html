              <h4>How DNS Forwarding Works?</h4>
              <p>The DNS is the address book of Internet. All protocols require DNS to connect to Internet. Applications
                can not communicate if they can not resolve the IP address of the domain they want to access. Because of
                this
                providing security over DNS is very effective.</p>
              <p>DNSCyte Secure DNS service handles DNS requests from its users and redirects malicious requests that
                are not allowed to access to the DNSCyte sinkhole IP address. This way, harmful traffic is stopped
                before it
                even begins.</p>
              <h4>Implementing DNS Forwarding</h4>
              <ol start="1" type="1">
                <li>Open an account from <a href="http://portal.dnscyte.com/" target="_blank">portal.dnscyte.com</a>
                </li>
                <li>Click the "Register" button at <a href="https://portal.dnscyte.com/#/register"
                    target="_blank">https://portal.dnscyte.com</a> and fill out the
                  form. All you need is to register an email address.</li>
                <li>Identify your external IP Address and security policy from the portal.</li>
                <li>The DNSCyte user portal is designed to be extremely easy to configure. Use Deployment -> Public IP
                  menu to define the external address.</li>
                <li>Select a profile from the profile list that you think is appropriate, or click "New Profile" to
                  create a
                  new profile</li>
                <li>Save your settings by clicking the Save Button.</li>
                <li>Enable devices on your network to use DNSCyte DNS Servers. Steps to enable this is based on how DNS
                  is
                  configured in your organisation.
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>- DNSCyte DNS Servers are 199.244.90.90 and 199.244.90.91</strong></li>
                    <li>- If you use a local DNS server, you must define DNSCyte DNS IP Addresses as forwarder DNS on
                      your
                      local DNS Server.</li>
                    <li>- If you do not use Local DNS, you must deploy DNSCyte DNS IP addresses as the DNS Server IP
                      Address
                      over DHCP.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ol>
